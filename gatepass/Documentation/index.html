                    <span>With the increase in number of students, better management of leave is required. This helps us in keeping a track of person who are on leave. 'What if you want to go on leave and the the authority is out for a day and you are not getting your leave?' or 'What if the authority wants to see who are out on leave?'<br>The leave management system is made on PHP and MySQL, manily focusing on requesting leave, allowing admin to make response for the leave, having a track on students who are out on a leave or suspending an ongoing leave.</span>
